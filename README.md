# installPkgs

To set up useful package libraries for Python, Julia, R, and the Atom editor, use the following:

1. `sh _setupPython.sh`
2. `julia _setupJulia.jl`
3. `R CMD BATCH _setupR.R` + see `_directionsR.md`
4. `sh _setupAtom.sh`

N.B., for these scripts to work as intended, base installations of these tools must be performed in advance.
